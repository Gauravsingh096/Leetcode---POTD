## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews, practicing problem-solving skills, and enhancing algorithmic thinking. By committing to solving at least one problem a day, I aim to:

- Sharpen my problem-solving abilities.
- Improve my coding efficiency.
- Prepare for technical interviews.
- Learn new algorithms and data structures.
